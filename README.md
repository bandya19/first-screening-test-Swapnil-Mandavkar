UI design task for the first screening test. Includes desktop and mobile layouts for 3 web sections using Manrope font and open-source icons.


🧠 Design Adaptations – Desktop & Mobile Versions

I recreated all three web sections as static designs in **1920×1080 px (desktop)** and also designed their **mobile-responsive versions**.

The overall structure, style, and content have been kept true to the original references, but a few thoughtful adjustments were made to improve usability, alignment, and responsiveness.

🔹 Section 1 – Pricing

 🖥️ Desktop
- Increased spacing between cards for better visual separation.
- Refined button and icon alignment for consistency.
- Balanced text size and layout hierarchy for pricing info.

📱 Mobile
- Stacked cards vertically for easy scrolling and better readability.
- Adjusted font sizes and padding to fit smaller screens.
- Reordered elements for a mobile-friendly layout flow.

🔹 Section 2 – Features

🖥️ Desktop
- Aligned all feature cards to a consistent grid layout.
- Adjusted spacing and typography for better visual rhythm.

📱 Mobile

🔹 Section 3 – Dashboard / Analytics

🖥️ Desktop
- Carefully aligned all chart and widget components.
- Used approximate visuals for graphs in static design.

📱 Mobile
- Rearranged dashboard cards into a vertical scroll format.
- Simplified some complex elements for smaller screen clarity.
- Ensured text, icons, and charts remain readable and touch-accessible.

All changes were made thoughtfully to maintain the integrity of the original design while optimizing for usability, spacing, and static responsiveness.
